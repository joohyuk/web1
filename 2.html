<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html" target="_blank" title="css specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a simple mechanism for adding style
(e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.
<p/>
<p>When the first CSS specification was published,
all of CSS was contained in one document that defined CSS Level 1.
<br>CSS Level 2 was defined also by a single, multi-chapter document.
However for CSS beyond Level 2, the CSS Working Group chose to adopt a modular approach,
where each module defines a part of CSS, rather than to define a single monolithic specification.
<br>This breaks the specification into more manageable chunks and allows more immediate,
incremental improvement to CSS.</p>
<img src="coding2.jpg" width="200">
<p>Since different CSS modules are at different levels of stability,
the CSS Working Group has chosen to publish this profile to define the current scope
and state of Cascading Style Sheets as of mid 2018. <br>This profile includes
only specifications that we consider stable and for which we have enough implementation
experience that we are sure of that stability.</p>
